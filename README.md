# Snake on native JavaScript

## Goal of the project


The main goal of this project was to make a copy of the game Snake as quickly as possible. To carry out this project I used JavaScript classes in order to have a more understandable code. The project was completed in 2/3 hours.

## Run the game

To run the game you just need to clone the project and launch the Snake.html file.
